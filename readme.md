# Pneumonia detection system using Tensorflow keras library

<h5>Pneumonia is a widespread and potentially severe lung infection that impacts millions globally. Prompt detection and treatment are essential for effectively managing this illness. Recent advancements in technology have greatly enhanced the precision and speed of medical diagnoses, including the identification of pneumonia. In this project, we will investigate how these technological methods can be used to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. Our goal is to develop a detection model that supports healthcare professionals by delivering quick and accurate diagnoses, helping to improve patient outcomes and save lives.<br><br>My model is designed to categorize chest X-ray images into three groups: Normal, Viral Pneumonia, and Bacterial Pneumonia.</h5>
